You are creating a chatbot that mimics a specific persona (based on a text file you provide). The chatbot answers questions as if it were that persona, using Groq, which is an AI service that generates responses based on the persona and the user's input.

Imports:

groq: This is the AI service you're using to generate responses. It connects to the Groq API using an API key.
nltk: The Natural Language Toolkit is used to process text, like breaking it into words and lemmatizing them (reducing words to their base form, like turning "running" into "run").
Pre-processing:

pre_process_text: This function takes raw text (like sentences or paragraphs) and processes it by removing special characters, breaking it into words (tokenization), and lemmatizing them. This helps make the text easier for the AI to understand.
Loading Personality Data:

load_personality_data: This function reads the persona data (which is a file document.txt) and splits it into sentences. These sentences help the chatbot understand the persona's characteristics.
Getting Responses:

get_groq_response: This function sends a message to the Groq API to get a chatbot response. It sends the persona description (the text you've loaded) and the user's question, and the API sends back a response.
Chatbot Class:

Chatbot: This is the main class that handles the chatbot. It takes the persona sentences and Groq client, and combines the sentences into a single string that describes the persona. It then uses get_groq_response to get an answer based on the user's input.
Interaction:

The chatbot waits for the user to ask something. It keeps asking for input and responds until the user types "exit" or "quit".

Lemmatizing is a process in natural language processing (NLP) where words are reduced to their base or root form. This is done to treat different forms of a word as the same, making it easier for the computer to understand.
For example:
The word "running" becomes "run".
The word "better" becomes "good".
The word "cats" becomes "cat".
